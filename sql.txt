SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.


SELECT od.OrderID AS "Order ID", p.ProductName AS "Product Name", od.Quantity
FROM OrderDetails od INNER JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID ORDER BY od.OrderID;
Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,


SELECT (e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName) AS EmployeeName, od.ProductID, od.Quantity
FROM Employees e, Orders o, OrderDetails od
WHERE e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID AND o.OrderID = od.OrderID
ORDER BY 1;
